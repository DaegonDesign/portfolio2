    <p id="quote">"Dark, raging waves shatter across the bow of an old galleon as it approaches the rocky shoals of the
pirate port. Its wooden hull covered in algae and barnacles; its sails torn and tattered by the merciless winds; 
its ropes and boards creaking from their strains; its men worn and wounded, beaten and broken by the very life they chose...
<br>Yet, the ship stays afloat. The hull leaks not a single drop. The wind still strikes the tattered sails. 
The boards and ropes still hold... And the men sail on, drinking, laughing and enjoying their free life until the day 
they meet their horrible demise in the murky waters of Krakenfall..."

<p class="maintext">Krakenfall is a large island made up of steep cliffsides and razor-sharp rocks, an unfriendly 
    environment populated by the worst of the worst. Located in the middle of the Arcadian Ocean, the port is 
    surrounded by numerous islands ready to be explored, terrible beasts to be slaughtered and wealthy
    merchants to be raided in the pursuit of wealth and glory.</p>

<!--chapter title-->

<p class="maintext">Every good crew needs a good ship - and a tiny wooden sloop with 
  moldy cloth sails and unreliable cast-iron cannons just won’t do! To become infamous, 
  feared and respected among pirates, you will need a vessel that strikes fear into the 
  hearts of your prey, or perhaps one that commands respect by its very presence.
  <br></br>
  As Krakenfall and the surrounding oceans are filled to the brim with exotic creatures 
  and materials infused with arcane energy to push beyond the limits of reality, its 
  only natural to claim those resources and use them to upgrade the floating fortress 
  you get to call home. A ship isn’t just a vessel, its a base 
  of operations, and should be treated as such. It’s your home, your vault of treasure, 
  your armory, as well as your weapon of mass destruction.
  <br></p>
  <div class="centeredtext"><p class="maintext">
    Krakenfall provides a variety of choices for ship customization, which include:</p></div>

      <p class="maintext">From the smallest of sloops to towering dreadnaughts, each ship
        has its own class which determines its size, weight, number of masts, sails and
        cannons, as well as the number of people needed to properly sail it.

         monstrous chitin or even elemental dragonscale.

    use of ammo can mean life and death.
